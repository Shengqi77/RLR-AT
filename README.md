## üõ†Ô∏è CDSP Code Instruction
### 1. Geometric Distortion Correction
Run the Demo_Distortion_Correction.m file for correcting the geometric distortion.
### 2. Blur Removal
We use [Uformer](https://github.com/ZhendongWang6/Uformer) for deblurring. The detailed methodology for constructing **blurred-sharp training data pairs** is provided in the **Section 3** of [supplementary materials](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2024/papers_ECCV/papers/05881-supp.pdf)  
```
git clone https://github.com/ZhendongWang6/Uformer.git
cd Uformer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üß© RLR-AT Dataset Download

**Small-version** (45 typical real turbulence videos. It's enough to use them to test your method.)
