## üõ†Ô∏è Code Instruction
### Step 1. Geometric Distortion Correction
Run the Demo_Distortion_Correction.m file for correcting the geometric distortion.
### Step 2. Blur Removal
We use [Uformer](https://github.com/ZhendongWang6/Uformer) for deblurring. 

**Uformer Setup**
```
git clone https://github.com/ZhendongWang6/Uformer.git
cd Uformer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Training Data**  
The details for constructing **Deblurring Training Data** are provided in the **Section 3.3** of [appendix](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2024/papers_ECCV/papers/05881-supp.pdf)  
**Training Code**   
```
#Please modify the paths for training data.
sh script/train_motiondeblur.sh
```
**Test Code**
```
#Please modify the paths for images and model weights.
python /test/test_realblur.py
```
**Pre-trained deblurring weights:**

## üß© Dataset Download

**Small-version** (Including 45 typical real turbulence videos. It's enough to use them for evaluation.)

## üëç Useful Resource
If you‚Äôre also working on turbulence mitigation, I strongly recommend that you look into the following resources. They could be of significant help to your researchÔºÅ

[Purdue Intelligent Imaging Lab (i2Lab)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/project_turbulence.html) 

i2Lab focuses on computational imaging and has produced many excellent works related to imaging through turbulence, including turbulence mitigation and simulation.
